The <b>wishlist</b> is an Android application that resulted from my University project for the Mobile App Development course. This is a simple wishlist app that can also help you track your savings so you can ultimately be able to purchase the items in your list.

This application makes use of [sqlite](https://github.com/sqlite/sqlite) for an embedded database, and many UI components such as Fragments, RecyclerViews controlled by ListAdapters, among others.
